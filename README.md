xDrive
======

xDrive is an iOS app for viewing and managing files stored in a Xythos files system. Browsed files and directories are stored locally allowing the user to maintain a cache of files on their device that can be viewed/used even in offline mode.

xDrive requires the Xythos server to be running xService (the server-side services for xDrive to communicate with). Default browsing paths (e.g. Home, Departments, etc.) are configured in xService and downloaded to the app upon login.

Currently only the following file types are supported for in-app viewing:

- pdf
- pages
- numbers
- key
- doc
- xls
- ppt
- txt
- rtf
- html
- jpg
- jpeg
- png
- m4v
- mov
- mp4
- mp3
- wav
- m4a
