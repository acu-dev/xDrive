xDrive
=====

xDrive is an iOS app for viewing and managing files stored in a Xythos files system. App functionality will behave similar to the Dropbox app by allowing the user to maintain a cache of files on their device that can be viewed/used even in offline mode.

xDrive requires the Xythos server to be running xService (the server-side services for xDrive to communicate with).
